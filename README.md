# Introduction
This is a Python implementation of the famous Chrome Dino game using the Pygame library and the NEAT algorithm. The game consists of a dinosaur character that needs to jump over cacti that appear randomly on the screen. The game speed increases over time, making it harder for the dinosaur to avoid the obstacles. The goal of the NEAT algorithm is to train the dinosaur to jump over obstacles without user intervention.

# Requirements
1. Python 3
2. Pygame library
N3. EAT-Python library

# Installation
To run the code, first, install the Pygame and NEAT-Python libraries. You can do this by running the following commands:
```
pip install pygame
pip install neat-python
```
Next, download the code from the repository.

# Usage
To run the game , open the terminal, navigate to the directory where the code is downloaded, and run the following command:
```
python main.py
```
This will run the game with pre-trained models. You can watch the dinosaur jump over cacti without user intervention.
